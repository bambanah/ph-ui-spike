  "This study aims to investigate the association between different treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, and the occurrence of pneumonitis in lung cancer patients. By analysing comprehensive patient data, we seek to identify patterns and correlations that can help improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes. Understanding the potential link between specific treatments and the development of pneumonitis will contribute to personalised care and guide treatment decisions in lung cancer patients.";
